This project will be a grand one. This is the website for Metro Ink, a NYC based Splatoon live event organizer. Hopefully this can be the start of a website that will server our organization and the community well. I aim to setup a home page, with pages for staff, merch, FAQ, contact, etc.

I will show my html skills of placing headers, images, links to other resources and proper headings for subjects. Maybe we use bold and italicization without being tacky. 

Ok we aren't doing Metro Ink yet... It will be food recipes! I would like to do some transitional graphics but im kind of a noob! Fuck it im building out the website. We fit the project requirements into this. We can build on this long term. hell yeah. FINALLY.
